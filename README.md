## Currently Supported Methods

###getFriendsList

Returns the friend list of any Steam user, provided their Steam Community profile visibility is set to "Public".

## TODO
- Valiation functions (steamID etc)
- Allow devs to specify the return format (json, xml, vdf)
- Probably best to change the structure to have a class for each of the APIs (news, user, userStats and TF Items)
- Add info about obtaining an API key
- Add info about the Valve Brand/Links, possible build these via a support method?
- Composer packageify & do the whole testing fun stoof
